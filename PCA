<--------- Basics --------->
- mean: average value of data set
  m = sum(xi, i = 1,...,N)/N
- standard deviation: average distance of data to the mean
  std= sqrt(sum((xi-m)^2, i=1,...,N)/(N-1)) 
  ATTN: Why is the demoninator (N-1) instead of N ???. 
  This is called Bessel's correction. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bessel's_correction
  An explanation is http://vortex.ihrc.fiu.edu/MET4570/members/Lectures/Lect05/m10divideby_nminus1.pdf
  The key is that the (N-1) case will result in unbiased estimation!
  
- variance: the data's spread
  var = std^2
